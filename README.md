# coviddata
The project is about exploring data in Microsoft SQL Server Management. I have tried to come up with some questions and with the help of SQL queries, I tried to get data of those questions and find out insight.

Here is the list of questions that I have listed:

Find out total cases, population and total infected percentage.

Find out daily total cases, total deaths, and the death rate for country-specific.

Find out the daily percentage of infected people with covid for country-specific.

Find out infection rate from highest to lowest compared to the population.

Find out the total death count from highest to lowest of each country.

Find out the total death count from highest to lowest of each continent.

Find out total death count from highest to lowest as per income level.

Find out daily total new cases, death, death percentage across the globe.

Find out total new cases, death, death percentage across the globe.

Find out total new cases, death, death percentage for a specific country.
